# Trajectopy API

Trajectory evaluation API for the Trajectopy project. Currently work in progress, this API allows to upload trajectories to a session and evaluate them regarding the ATE and RPE metrics. The uploaded trajectories are stored in the local filesystem. The metadata of the session and the trajectories are stored in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

## Documentation

The API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs.
